    our ministry services. We only collect information that you provide to us from telephone
    conversations, voice mail, e-mail, or on applications or forms from this website.
</p>
<p>
    We are a ministry of <a href="http://www.coloradocommunity.org">Colorado Community Church</a> 
    therefore we share information with
    Colorado Community Church so that we can work together to meet your needs. We may
    disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, with Colorado Community
    Church. We share information with nonaffiliated third parties when they are acting
    on our behalf, or acting jointly with us. Where relevant, we may disclose all of
    the information we collect, as described above, to appropriate third parties, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Colorado Community Church</li>
    <li>Denver Rescue Mission</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These third parties will be involved in granting or processing your donation or
    computer request on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
    We will not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to anyone for the
    purpose of marketing or soliciting products or services other than our own.
</p>
<p>
    We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of your information. We
    use SSL which means your information is sent by encrypted text to the server. Please
    do not register on this site with a bank password or company network password! Personally
    identifiable information such as your name, phone number, address, and e-mail address
    are also sent with encrypted text to the server. You always have the option to call
    or e-mail us directly with your information if you desire a higher level of secure
    communication.

<p>
    We do not ask for sensitive information such as social security numbers or credit
    card numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Only Lifebyte volunteers are granted access to personally identifiable information.
    Furthermore, all volunteers are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices
    any time new policies are added. Our volunteers are notified and/or reminded about
    the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure your information
    is protected. Finally, our servers will not store personally identifiable information
    about you other than basic phone book information such as your name, address, phone
    number, and e-mail address.
