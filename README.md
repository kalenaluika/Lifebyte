[Lifebyte](http://lifebyte.org/) - Computer Ministry
================================

Project Status
--------------

We worked on the project for a month inside [LifebyteMVC](https://github.com/StewShack/Lifebyte/tree/master/src/LifebyteMVC) and made decent progress.

Three volunteers that were new to Web Development joined the team. We created a folder called [LifebyteHtml](https://github.com/StewShack/Lifebyte/tree/master/src/LifebyteHtml) as a way to learn HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

Current development is taking place under [LifebyteMVC3](https://github.com/StewShack/Lifebyte/tree/master/src/LifebyteMVC3).

We welcome your input. The goal of the project is to upgrade the existing Lifebyte website to MVC 3.

E-mail us at [webmaster@lifebyte.org](mailto:webmaster@lifebyte.org) or call our voice mail at 303-256-1224 to join.

We have several teams: 

* Donations - The donations team collects the donations. Anything we cannot use is recycled through our partner [Luminous Recycling](http://www.luminousrecycling.com/wp/).

* Builders go to the storage unit and pick up equipment. We rebuild the computers and get them ready for delivery.

* Delivery - No matter what team you are on, you should join us for deliveries. The more people we have at the delivery day, the more computers we can provide to the Denver community. This is also you chance to be a blessing, pray with people, and see if they have any needs beyond the computer that our church can help them with.

* Servants - If you are helping with this website. You are a servant. If you are the leader of Lifebyte, you are a servant. The servant team is the glue that holds this ministry together.
